  "critique_summary": "Spec was well-structured and technically sound overall, but had 5 issues ranging from high to low severity. The most critical issue was the missing React 18 initialization pattern - essential for proper implementation since React 18 changed the initialization API from ReactDOM.render() to createRoot(). Other issues included suboptimal Electron import patterns, an edge case without solution, React.FC usage inconsistency, and a missing note about Electron's built-in types. All issues have been fixed with verified changes to spec.md.",

  "recommendations": [
    "Spec is now ready for implementation",
    "The React 18 entry point pattern addition is critical - implementers should follow this closely",

    "Using 'electron/preload' imports will provide better TypeScript type inference in the Electron preload script",
    "Future specs should include framework initialization patterns as a standard section"
