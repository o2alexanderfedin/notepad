=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Dual-Platform Notepad with Automatic Syntax Highlighting
Workspace: /Users/alexanderfedin/Projects/hapyy/playground/notepad
Started: 2025-12-26 15:05:00

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Greenfield feature implementation building a complete dual-platform application
from scratch. Requires architecture design, core functionality implementation, and
cross-platform compatibility without modifying existing code.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Updated project_index.json with dual-platform service configuration
- Updated context.json with patterns and technical constraints
- Created init.sh for environment setup
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 19

Phase Summary:

Phase 1 (phase-1-setup): Project Setup
  - 3 subtasks
  - Depends on: []
  - Creates: package.json, directory structure, installs dependencies

Phase 2 (phase-2-abstraction): File System Abstraction Layer
  - 1 subtask
  - Depends on: [phase-1-setup]
  - Creates: Unified file system interface for both platforms

Phase 3 (phase-3-browser): Browser Implementation
  - 4 subtasks
  - Depends on: [phase-2-abstraction]
  - Creates: Browser file system handler, HTML UI, app initialization, Vite config
  - PARALLEL with Phase 4

Phase 4 (phase-4-electron): Electron Implementation
  - 5 subtasks
  - Depends on: [phase-2-abstraction]
  - Creates: Electron main process, preload script, file system handler, renderer, HTML UI
  - PARALLEL with Phase 3

Phase 5 (phase-5-editor): Shared Editor Logic
  - 2 subtasks
  - Depends on: [phase-3-browser, phase-4-electron]
  - Creates: Editor with Highlight.js integration, application styles

Phase 6 (phase-6-integration): Integration and Verification
  - 5 subtasks
  - Depends on: [phase-5-editor]
  - Verifies: Browser app, Electron app, E2E file operations on both platforms

Services Involved:
- notepad-app: Dual-platform text editor application with automatic syntax highlighting
  - Tech stack: JavaScript, Electron, Vite, Highlight.js
  - Browser target: File System Access API (Chromium only)
  - Electron target: Native file system via secure IPC

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  * Phase 3 (Browser) and Phase 4 (Electron) can run simultaneously
  * Both depend only on Phase 2 (abstraction layer)
  * No file conflicts between browser and Electron implementations
- Speedup estimate: 1.3x faster than sequential execution

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: medium
- Test types: unit, integration, e2e
- Security scanning: not required
- Staging deployment: not required
- Key checks:
  * Unit tests for file system abstraction
  * Integration tests for browser and Electron platforms
  * E2E tests for file open/edit/save flows
  * Security verification for Electron IPC (contextIsolation, contextBridge)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 2

This will start 2 parallel workers to implement phases 3 and 4 simultaneously.

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Next session will begin implementation starting with:
1. Phase 1: Project setup (package.json, directory structure)
2. Phase 2: File system abstraction layer
3. Phases 3 & 4: Browser and Electron implementations (in parallel)
4. Phase 5: Shared editor with syntax highlighting
5. Phase 6: Integration and E2E verification

Status: PLANNING COMPLETE - Ready for implementation
