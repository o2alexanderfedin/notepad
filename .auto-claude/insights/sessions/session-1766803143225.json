Based on the `package.json`, here's how to start the app:\n## Starting the App\nYou have **two options** depending on how you want to run the notepad:\n### 1. **Browser Mode** (Web version)\n```bash\nnpm run dev:browser\n```\nThis starts the app using Vite's development server in your web browser.\n### 2. **Electron Mode** (Desktop app)\n```bash\nnpm run dev:electron\n```\nThis launches the app as a standalone Electron desktop application.\n---\n### First Time Setup\nIf you haven't installed dependencies yet, run this first:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\nThen choose either browser or Electron mode to start developing!\n**Note:** The app is a dual-platform notepad with automatic syntax highlighting that can run both in the browser and as a desktop app, built with React, TypeScript, and Redux.",
