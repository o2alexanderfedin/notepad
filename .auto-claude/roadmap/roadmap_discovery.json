    "primary_persona": "Developers and programmers who need a lightweight, cross-platform code editor with automatic syntax highlighting for quick file editing",
    "secondary_personas": [
      "Technical writers editing markdown and documentation files",
      "System administrators editing configuration files (YAML, JSON, shell scripts)",
      "Students learning to code who want a simple, non-intimidating editor",
      "Power users who want a fast notepad alternative with syntax highlighting"
    ],
    "pain_points": [
      "Heavy IDEs (like VSCode/IntelliJ) take too long to start for quick edits",
      "Built-in text editors (Notepad, TextEdit) lack syntax highlighting",
      "Want to view/edit code files directly in the browser without installing software",
      "Need a consistent editing experience across desktop and web",
      "Existing browser-based editors require cloud accounts or complex setup"
    ],
    "goals": [
      "Quickly open and edit code files with syntax highlighting",
      "Use the same familiar interface in browser and desktop",
      "Access files from local file system without uploading to cloud",
      "Identify programming language automatically without manual selection",
      "Have a minimal, distraction-free editing experience"
    ],
    "usage_context": "Quick file editing sessions - opening a config file, making small code changes, viewing source code with highlighting. Used when full IDE is overkill. Desktop version for regular use, browser version for ad-hoc access on shared computers or when software installation isn't possible."

    "one_liner": "A lightweight, dual-platform notepad with automatic syntax highlighting that runs seamlessly in both browser and desktop.",
    "problem_statement": "Developers frequently need to quickly view or edit code files, but face a choice between slow, heavyweight IDEs or basic text editors without syntax highlighting. Existing lightweight editors are often platform-specific and don't offer browser-based access.",
    "value_proposition": "Zero-friction code editing with automatic language detection and syntax highlighting, available instantly in any modern browser or as a native desktop app - no cloud accounts, no complex setup, just fast local file editing.",

      "Atom (discontinued) - Was similar concept but heavier",
      "Monaco Editor (online) - Browser-based but complex setup",
      "CodeMirror (online) - Browser-based, library not standalone app",
      "TextEdit/Notepad (OS built-in) - Simple but no syntax highlighting"
    ],
    "differentiators": [
      "True dual-platform: same codebase runs in browser AND as desktop app",
      "Zero configuration - works out of the box with auto language detection",
      "No cloud account required - local file system access only",
      "Lightweight startup - faster than full IDEs",
      "Privacy-focused - files never leave local machine",
      "Modern browser API usage (File System Access API) for native-like experience"
    ],
    "market_position": "Positioned as a 'lightweight middle ground' between basic text editors and full IDEs. Targets developers who want quick file editing with syntax highlighting without the overhead of a complete IDE. The dual-platform approach is unique - most alternatives are either browser-only or desktop-only.",
